# Online Resume - Capstone Project 1

## Project Overview
This is a simple online resume built as part of the **Complete Full-Stack Web Development Bootcamp** on Udemy. The goal of this project is to create a structured HTML-only resume that displays essential information about education, work experience, skills, and other relevant details.

## Project Specifications
1. Create an HTML file named `index.html`.
2. Use the `<!DOCTYPE html>` declaration at the beginning of the file to indicate that it's an HTML document.
3. Create a `head` section that includes a `title` element with the text **"My Resume"**.
4. Inside the `body` section, write HTML code to create an online resume covering the following aspects:
   - **Summary or objective statement**
   - **Education** (list degrees, schools, and dates)
   - **Work experience** (list job titles, employers, dates, and responsibilities)
   - **Skills** (list relevant skills or areas of expertise)
   - **Awards, certifications, or other achievements** (list any relevant awards, certifications, or other accomplishments)
5. Use appropriate HTML tags to format the content of each section, such as `<h1>` for section headings and `<ul>` or `<ol>` for lists.
6. Use HTML tags to add a profile photo of yourself.
7. Use relevant anchor tags to create a multi-page website, listing other aspects of your resume such as **Hobbies** and **Contact details**.
8. Add a `footer` element with your name and any copyright information or other disclaimers. *(Hint: use the MDN docs for things you don't know how to do: [MDN Footer Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/footer))*
9. Save the `index.html` file and open it in a web browser to ensure that it displays correctly.
10. Add your website to your GitHub to start building your portfolio.
11. Publish your website using **GitHub Pages** and share it here (in the Q&A) with other students.
12. Comment and make suggestions to other students' projects.

## Requirements
- **Only HTML**: In order to keep the project within scope (time, energy, resources), you can only use HTML to complete this project. Even if you know CSS and JS (which we're assuming you don't yet), you are expected to only write the website using HTML.
- **Self-sufficiency**: Imagine you are a professional developer working on this project. There will be things you don't know, things you want to do but haven't yet learned how to. As a professional developer, you need to know the limits of your abilities and look up other things in Google, MDN docs, and the internet.
